#Weather App
A simple weather application that fetches real-time weather data for a user-specified city. The app uses the WeatherAPI service to get weather data, and is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app demonstrates skills in working with APIs, handling asynchronous operations using Promises, and creating a responsive user interface.

Features
Display current weather for any city.
Shows temperature, humidity, and weather condition (e.g., Clear, Cloudy, Rainy).
Fetches data from WeatherAPI using XMLHttpRequest.
User-friendly and responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile.
Error handling for invalid city names or API errors.
Optionally, you can add features like geolocation or unit toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

#How It Works
When a user enters a city name and clicks "Get Weather", the app sends a request to the WeatherAPI.
The data (temperature, humidity, weather condition, etc.) is displayed in the result section.
If the city is invalid or if there's an error fetching data, an error message is displayed.
The app uses XMLHttpRequest to fetch the data and handle errors gracefully.
